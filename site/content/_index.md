    Nowadays, I mainly race the Stars. Josh Revkin and I were able to secure the
    big Star World Cup last year earning us the Gold star finally. We are
    looking to defend the title this year in Oxford in October.

    I do some pro sailing in the big boats as pretty much any position as long
    as it's aft of the mast. As Barney said a long time ago "My time on foredeck
    is over". I might do it occasionally for fun because I must admit that's
    where the action is.

    **I believe in the basics of sailing and my 3 basic rules are simple:**

    1. Be close to the starting line when the gun goes off.
    2. Sail faster than the others.
    3. Sail shorter than the others.
